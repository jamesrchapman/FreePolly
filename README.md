This project aims to train a text-to-speech (TTS) system to mimic the voice of a specific person using Tacotron 2, a deep learning model for speech synthesis. By providing a dataset of audio recordings of the target person, the TTS system can generate speech that sounds similar to the target person's voice.

## Features

- Train a Tacotron 2 model to learn the voice characteristics of a specific person.
- Generate speech from text input that sounds like the target person's voice.
- Fine-tune the pre-trained Tacotron 2 model with a custom dataset.

## Requirements

- Python (version X.X.X)
- TensorFlow (version X.X.X)
- Other dependencies (specify any additional dependencies, such as NumPy, Pandas, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-cloning.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the pre-trained Tacotron 2 model:

```
# Provide instructions on how to download the pre-trained model or how to train it from scratch
```

4. Prepare your dataset:

```
# Provide instructions on how to prepare the dataset, including audio recordings and transcriptions
```

## Usage

1. Run the training script:

```
python train.py --dataset /path/to/dataset --model /path/to/pretrained_model
```

2. Monitor the training progress and adjust the hyperparameters as needed.

3. Generate speech using the trained model:

```
python generate.py --model /path/to/trained_model --text "Hello, how are you?"
```

4. Evaluate the quality of the generated speech and fine-tune the model if necessary.
